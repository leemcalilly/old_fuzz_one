      %h2 About Us
      %p It’s no secret that guitar players love their instruments, so it's a shame the rest of their gear doesn't inspire that kind of devotion. We're out to change that with a line of road-tested accessories that come with a lifetime guarantee. We're Original Fuzz, and we're bringing quality design and craftsmanship to the gear guitar players depend on.
      %p Original Fuzz was created by Zach & Lee. We’re two musicians who have been lugging around cables, pedals, picks, and other random gear since our hands were big enough to make a barre chord. Years of frustration and damaged gear led us to design a new kind of gear bag, the Fuzz Bag. And with that Original Fuzz was born. We're based in the Riverside neighborhood of Jacksonville, FL and we're relentless participants in our local music scene.
      %p If you have any questions or concerns with an order, have feedback, or just want to chat, we'd love for you to contact us. You can also follow our blog, subscribe to our email updates, or catch us on Twitter.
